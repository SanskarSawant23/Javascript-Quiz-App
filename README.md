# Javascript-Quiz-App

There are Important Javascript concepts that are used building this project.
1.Array objecs
2.Dom Manupulation
3.For Each loop
4.Array Map function(Although it is not used in this project but it can be used as a alternative to for Each loop).

More importantly I have learned how to think while making an webapp and how to ideas to logic that can make app work good.
