# Javascript-Quiz-App

There are Important Javascript concepts that are used in building this project.
1. Array objects
2. Dom Manipulation
3. For Each loop
4. Array Map function(Although it is not used in this project it can be used as an alternative to for Each loop).

More importantly, I have learned how to think while making a web app and how to use logic that can make the app work well.
